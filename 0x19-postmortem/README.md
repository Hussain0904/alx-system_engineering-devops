Postmortem Report for Database Outage Incident
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start Time: June 22, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: June 22, 2024, 1:30 PM (UTC)

Impact:
Our customer database experienced a total outage, rendering our web application and customer support systems unusable. Users were unable to log in, retrieve account information, or perform transactions. Approximately 90% of our user base was affected, causing significant disruption to services and an increase in customer complaints.

Root Cause:
A routine maintenance script inadvertently deleted critical database indexes, causing severe performance degradation and eventually leading to a complete database lockup.

Timeline
10:00 AM: Issue detected via monitoring alerts showing database query timeouts and failures.
10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating; initial assumption was a sudden increase in traffic.
10:20 AM: Confirmed database was unresponsive; began checking recent changes.
10:30 AM: Misleading path: suspected hardware failure; restarted database servers.
11:00 AM: Restart had no effect; escalated to the database administration team.
11:30 AM: DBA team identified missing indexes from the maintenance logs.
12:00 PM: Started the process of recreating the missing indexes.
1:00 PM: Indexes recreated; database performance began to improve.
1:30 PM: Full service restored and incident officially resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was an error in a routine maintenance script that, instead of updating, deleted several critical database indexes. Without these indexes, database queries became extremely slow, leading to timeouts and an eventual lockup of the database.

Resolution:
The resolution involved recreating the deleted indexes. The DBA team analyzed the maintenance logs to identify the missing indexes and executed scripts to recreate them. Once the indexes were restored, the database performance improved, and normal operations resumed.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Script Validation: Implement strict validation checks for all maintenance scripts. Scripts should be reviewed and tested in a sandbox environment before being run on production databases.
Automated Backups: Ensure automated backups of database schema, including indexes, are taken before any maintenance work.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve database monitoring to detect sudden drops in performance metrics that might indicate missing indexes.
Audit Logs: Maintain detailed audit logs of all database maintenance activities for quicker diagnosis and recovery.
Task List:

 Implement validation checks for maintenance scripts.
 Set up automated backups of database schema and indexes before maintenance.
 Enhance database monitoring for performance drops and missing indexes.
 Maintain and regularly review detailed audit logs of maintenance activities.
 Conduct training sessions on the importance of database indexes and proper maintenance procedures.
By implementing these measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future, ensuring more stable and reliable database operations.
